# Encrypted ASI (Artificial Superintelligence) Engine

This repository contains the Unreal ASI Engine, a powerful toolkit for developing advanced AI applications. The core algorithms and mathematical implementations are encrypted to protect intellectual property while allowing developers to freely build real-world applications using the public API.

## Features

- **Encrypted Core**: All core algorithms and mathematical implementations are securely encrypted
- **Public API**: Clean, easy-to-use API for accessing ASI capabilities
- **Free Access**: Anyone can use the ASI engine to build applications
- **Example Applications**: Sample applications demonstrating ASI capabilities

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/unreal-asi-engine.git
   cd unreal-asi-engine
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Initialize the ASI engine:
   ```
   python setup.py
   ```

### Using the ASI Engine

The ASI engine is accessed through the public API, which provides a simple interface for using ASI capabilities:

```python
from unreal_asi.asi_public_api import initialize_asi, create_asi_instance

# Initialize ASI engine
initialize_asi()

# Create an ASI instance
asi = create_asi_instance(name="MyASI")

# Use ASI capabilities
patterns = asi.discover_patterns(domain="healthcare", properties={
    "blood_pressure": 0.75,
    "heart_rate": 0.65,
    "respiratory_rate": 0.5,
    "temperature": 0.6
})

insights = asi.generate_insight(concepts=["health", "wellness", "treatment"])

timeline = asi.predict_timeline({
    "name": "Treatment Plan",
    "complexity": 0.7,
    "uncertainty": 0.5,
    "domain": "healthcare"
})
```

## Examples

See the `/unreal_asi/applications/examples` directory for sample applications demonstrating how to use the ASI engine:

- Healthcare Analyzer
- Financial Market Analyzer
- Creative Content Generator
- Strategic Decision Assistant
- Pattern Discovery Tool

## Encryption

The core ASI algorithms and mathematical implementations are encrypted to protect intellectual property. The encryption is handled transparently through the public API, so developers don't need to worry about it.

A default public license key is included that allows anyone to use the ASI engine for free. Commercial applications should obtain a commercial license.
