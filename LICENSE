===================================================================

This software implements the Mock Root ZK Entropy Licensing Protocol
(MR-ZKELP) which automatically detects usage patterns and environment
to enforce this dual license model.

1. The software contains mechanisms to detect usage patterns,
   deployment environments, and computational scale.

2. For usage above specified thresholds, the software will require
   a valid license key that can only be provided by GlobalSushrut.

3. Attempting to bypass the licensing mechanism is prohibited
   and may result in legal action.

4. License keys are non-transferrable and bound to specific
   organizations/deployments.
